Vienna To-Do File
=================

This file is out of date.

Update this file with a list of things that users have requested but which aren't yet implemented.
Thanks!

General
=======
Now that RSS support is added, it's all a bit of a hack. The connect code really
needs some significant refactoring to separate out the CIX and RSS stuff. I didn't
do this up-front as I wasn't sure how the separation would look and it was just
easier to integrate the RSS code into the existing code bit by bit. Instead now
that the full functionality is there, we can look at the common bits of CIX and RSS
services and consider separating them out in a future version.

Mainly 1.4.x Stuff
==================
- Improve ParseXmlDate in XMLParser.m. Make it more efficient.
- Fix character set translation.

Requested Features
==================
- Allow sending 8-bit chrs cleanly.
- Support searching scoped by folders. (2.0 has an implementation of this that could be backported).
- Killfile.
