<p class="style2"><br />
Vole was formerly known as Vienna or Vinkix, but it was renamed in December 2011 and Mid 2012 to avoid conflicting with another Vienna App which was also a RSS feed reader.</p>

<p class="style2"><b>Steve Palmer (spalmer) writes</b>: Vienna is a personal project that I began in order to learn to program on my new Apple Powerbook. I picked Vienna because I am a long time member of the CIX online community and the author of the official CIX off-line reader, Ameol. Vienna represents an evolution of Ameol that I had in my mind for a long time but until now, never got around to writing.</p>
