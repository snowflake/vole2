Vole was formerly known as Vienna. It was renamed to avoid conflict
with the Vienna RSS and Atom reader.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you are using the git repository from github.com, you will notice that
the commits are shown as unverified. This is because the Git repository
is exported from the master Fossil repository and it is not possible to sign
the commits with GPG.

The master Fossil repository IS signed with a GPG key. Enable the manifest in
your Fossil settings and look for the manifest file in the root directory.
For details of where to obtain the Fossil repository, please ask in the CIX
vienna conference.
